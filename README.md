dotfiles for my laptop

refined specifically for my laptop [14 inch macbook pro]

required:
- [niri](https://github.com/yalter/niri)
- [danklinux dotfile setup](https://danklinux.com)
- [Bibata Modern Classic cursor](https://store.kde.org/p/1914825) wherever you store your cursors

if you have something that's not the laptop i have you'll probably need to change the display settings in `niri/config.kdl`

### extra things:
- laptop: 14 inch macbook pro 2021
- OS: Fedora Asahi Remix 42 (with notched area rendering enabled)
- music player: kew
- fetch thing(??): nerdfetch
- wallpaper: from [David Revoy](https://framapiaf.org/@davidrevoy/110519900449848982)
- `userChrome.css` file inside `firefox_css` lowers minimum firefox width in order to make 33% look fine
