dotfiles for my laptop

refined specifically for my laptop [14 inch macbook pro]

required:
- [niri](https://github.com/yalter/niri)
- [danklinux dotfile setup](https://danklinux.com)
- [Bibata Modern Classic cursor](https://store.kde.org/p/1914825) wherever you store your cursors

if you have something that's not the laptop i have you'll probably need to change the display settings in `niri/config.kdl`
